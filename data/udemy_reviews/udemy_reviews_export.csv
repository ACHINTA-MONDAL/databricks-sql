But it lacks in depth of concepts, it barely touches all topic, but no deep dive. 

It would be better, if there are following modules explaining
1.  cost model of databricks
2. what is DBFS ? How it works ?
3. Best practices around platform
4. how automatically deploy, monitor, debug a production application."

"Data Engineering Essentials using SQL, Python, and PySpark",2022-07-01 21:44:42,1.0,Extremely confusing setups (for AWS). Too fast when typing commands that are essential for setups. Too slow when talking about unimportant stuff. Very hard to understand accent and speaking too fast. Now jumped from AWS to Windows. Needs a section by section roadmap for each OS.

Data Engineering using AWS Data Analytics Services,2022-06-17 13:07:29,5.0,As part of my day to day job as a Data Engineer at a startup I have the constant need to get upskilled on the various AWS services related to leveraging Data. I could either spend hours on AWS documentation reading up on them OR just go to the particular section in this course and get educated on it. This course has provided me with the hands-on learning experience which is absolutely important when you're trying to ramp up on AWS either for your job or for the AWS Data Analytics Specialty certification. With that said I have already recommended Durga Gadiraju's course to folks in my network

Data Engineering using AWS Data Analytics Services,2022-06-17 07:52:37,5.0,"Well I have been following all the courses by Durga sir. But after learning bigdata now I was looking to learn more on cloud side. How things work in cloud in AWS. Some how I came across this course by Durga sir and I immediately went for it. They way Durga sir explains concept is really commendable. I don't have to go here and there googling things.
Although at one point I got stuck at one of the installation process, so I asked for Help and Durga sir by himself came 1 on 1 to resolve my issue. So this is the best thing I have seen. Person is so dedicated to whatever he does. You will not feel as if you have taken a online course for few bucks but rather it will give you a classroom feeling.
I would highly recommend if you are new to aws and looking for hands on to learn and grow"

Pros: 
1. It focused well on the API's part and that is good. That is major portion of the real exam. 
Cons: 
1. Should have better content in architecture part. 
2. Garbage collection related topic is missing. There are couple of questions related to that also in the exam .
3. Should have explained the answers in the practice paper.
4. Should have additional practice papers for practice."

"Data Engineering Essentials using SQL, Python, and PySpark",2022-06-12 10:33:53,2.0,"The course is too long, and many things are too rambling and out of focus.
- I really hope this course can provide basic knowledge as well as a project on data engineering. But nevertheless n has too much rambling knowledge
- you did very well the sql part also python. But there's really no need to be so detailed
- in hadoop and spark, it's too fast and lacks details
- I've seen videos that are cut and don't follow what you show in the course.
- in the hadoop and spark section you explain very confusingly, most of what you show I can't follow because of the lack of interactivity
- nothing is clear
- chaotic
- I never saw you develop gw02.itversity.com ? m02.itversity.com ?. Where do these come from? It's really messy and disorganized
- I thought that you can make a basic system from input data and output data that can give me a real understanding of what a data engineering project consists of and how the complete steps are performed. It doesn't need to be too advanced, but it needs to create the basics for people to build on."
